# Player scripts for Warrior.js

This repo holds the scripts I've written for each level of `warrior.js`. The script for each level is in a separate file, it is **not** intended to be an example of the best or most efficient solution, it's just a record of my solution that others may find interesting to compare against.

# Warrior.js

Is a javascript game where you program an AI to defeat monsters in a tower. You can find more info in the [official repo](https://github.com/olistic/warriorjs) or play the game in browser [here](https://warriorjs.com/).
